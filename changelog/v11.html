		<h>AS-Skadi v0.11 Alpha (Aug 16th 2020)</h>
		<p id="changelog" class="changelog">- Added Stats Overview page to check the stats of the team.
- Added voltage gain per note.
- Added an overview of voltage gain when hovering over the voltage gain message.
- Added colors to strategy. The voltage gain message will be colored depending on the strategy it is in. (A = Red, B = Green, C = Green).
- Added changelog (this page you're likely reading right now!).
- Added Matching attribute bonus to Stamina and Technique (1.2x).
- Changed Settings Menu in simulator to always stay at the top, never go down.
- Merged Critical and Voltage gain per note notifications. Disabling Critical notifications will only hide the critical part and still show the voltage gain.
- Removed the ability to upload a JSON file directly in a simulation. Use Import Profile.
- Updated About to add contact information.
- Fixed Accessories stats only counting for one card, instead of the whole strategy.
- Fixed certain calculations ignoring matching attribute bonus.
